# MDS-556-Course-Project
Project for Analytical Methods Course

This project was part of my final work for the Analytical Methods course of the Elmhurst University Masters in Data Science program. 

The goal of the project is to predict loan-charge off's for a fictional client and provide recommendations based on data modeling. The dataset was found on Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/azeem1607/credit-prediction-interest-rate-environments. 

## How you can help

- Check out my code and the dataset and see if you can improve model performance through feature engineering and see if other features can be created.
